# LinusTechTips scripts
A set of user scripts and styles for [LinusTechTips.com](http://linustechtips.com/main/) to enhance your browsing experience. [This thread](http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/193630-complete-list-of-forum-addons-scripts-apps-etc/) has links to all of these scripts and more (some created by me, others not), so I would recommend that you go and check it out.

If you have any suggestions for changes, improvements or new scripts, feel free to either post it in [this thread](http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/193630-complete-list-of-forum-addons-scripts-apps-etc/) or submit a GitHub issue here.
